upload arduino_uno_humanoid_robot in arduino uno.
upload humanoid_robot_arduino_nano to arduino nano.
I seperated the code for arduino uno and nano because if I upload all the sketch at one board the stability problem will be there. It already happened so that I shortened the code and seperated you can add more commands in the code if you have doubt you can contact me through mail jayarajnitheesh69@gmail.com this is my mail id.
